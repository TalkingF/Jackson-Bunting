## Background
Tiny Timer is a pomodoro inspired time developed in typescript and tailwind. The project allows you to set the length of a timer through presets and manual adjustments with pausing and stopping functionality. 

The project currently has a WIP task/note system which will allow you to store notes in local storage.

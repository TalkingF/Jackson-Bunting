## Background
Chess Rumble was a group project developed developed in C++ and a general purpose medial library SFML. It was a limited implementation of Chess with a GUI with pawns having an area of effect when they take a piece. 

The project taught me a lot about operating in a group and the inherrent differences from personal projects.

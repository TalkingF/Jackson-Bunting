## Background
Pop! is a game developped in C++ using a game library called raylib. It relies on a relativley simple design, with the main purpose of this projet being lerning CMake and git submodules to work with external libraries. Often and for good reason, much of my work especially within university had us reinventing the wheel, but that may not always be the case, which is why I was eager to learn dependency managment. 

The game features a GUI for restarting the game or exiting, statistics for time spent, health and points as well as sound effects when popping a balloon or missing.

The project was an excellent opportunity to learn some vital skills around managing codebases, scope and bit of modern C++ on the side.
